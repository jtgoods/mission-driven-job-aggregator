A brief description of the concept of this project

Purpose Statement: To deliver new leads (job oppostunities/ads) to users in a simple way. These leads are customized to each user. Problem Summary: Searching job boards and refreshing pages and updating your google sheet to track applications and interviews is tedious and annoying. Core MVP:

Job Fetcher: pulls listings from selected sources (e.g. Indeed API, RemoteOK, or CSV uploads)
Mission Filter: searches for keywords like "sustainability," "nonprofit," "health care," "ethical tech."
User Profile: stores the user's interests, values, and skills for custom filtering.
Job Tracker: let's users mark jobs as "Applied," "Interested," or "Saved for later."
Email Digest: sends a daily/weekly list of new relevant jobs
