# mission-driven-job-aggregator
A Python tool that aggregates job postings from mission-driven companies across climate tech, mental health, social impact, and sustainability sectors.

## The Problem

Finding jobs at mission-driven companies means checking 10+ different job boards:
- Built In (tech startups)
- Climatebase (climate tech)
- Idealist (nonprofits)
- Tech Jobs for Good (social impact)
- Wellfound (startups with mission)
- Plus individual company career pages

It's exhausting, time-consuming, and you probably miss opportunities.

## The Solution

This tool automatically:
- Scrapes multiple job boards
- Filters for relevant roles (customer success, operations, implementation, etc.)
- Categorizes by mission area (climate, mental health, food systems, justice)
- Aggregates into one searchable list
- (Future) Sends weekly email digests of new matching jobs

## Current Status

**Phase 1 (Starting Soon):** Basic Python scraper
- Learning Python fundamentals in Maestro Term 1
- Target: Working MVP by December 2025

## Roadmap

### Phase 1: MVP (Term 1-2, Dec 2025)
- Python script that scrapes 2-3 job boards

- Runs locally on my computer

### Phase 2: Better Data (Term 2, Mar 2026)
- Add 5-8 job boards total
- Categorize by mission type
